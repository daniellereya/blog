# My Personal Blog

This is a project I wrote in order to get famiiarized with some new technologies and frameworks, like:
On the client side:
- React JS
- Redux
- Webpack
- ES6 new features
- Testing frameworks (Mocha, Chai, etc.)
- ImmutableJS

On the server:
- Ruby on Rails

Eventually, it will contain my personal page and blog about Tech and Leadership.
